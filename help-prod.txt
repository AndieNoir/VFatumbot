Welcome to Fatumbot! This is a tool to experiment with the ideas that the mind and matter are connected in more ways than currently understood, and that by visiting random (in the true sense of the word) places one can journey outside of their normal probability paths.

APP_VERSION is in beta test! There may still be some issues. New features:

- Making it more accessible to people not only on Telegram via Facebook, WebChat etc.
- Ability to set location by searching addresses.
- Option to ignore water points.
- Offering an easy virtual trip to points via Google Street View/Earth (for you lazy ones).
- Make it a bit easier to use with buttons.
- Help connect the community more with trip reporting. 
- Strengthened privacy - use the WebChat interface to the bot at https://bot.randonauts.com for complete anonymity (it anonymizes all your IDs and resets your location info every 24 hours).

By using the Fatum Project bot you do so at your own risk! In no way are we responsible or will be held liable for any positive or adverse affects or consequences from the use of this platform. Use common sense, do not put yourself or others in harms way. Don't tresspass.

Below is the original welcome message from the Telegram-based bot (some parts don't apply, we'll update it in the future):

*** PRO TIP!! WHEN VISITING ATTRACTORS: BRING A GARBAGE BAG WITH YOU AND PICK UP ANY GARBAGE YOU SEE ***

INSTRUCTIONS

Select the center of the map:

The Points will be calculated inside a given radius around the center. It is recommended to set your current location as a center.
By default calculation area is set to 3000m circle around London.  
To change the area, you can send your current location via telegram mobile-app in-built function "Send location", it will be set as a map center.
If you are using Telegram Desktop, find desired location on Google Maps and sen a link to it like this:  https://www.google.com/maps/@54.9831153,73.3224661,21z
(The link should have the same format as in example)

Select area radius:

If the map center is your current location, area radius will be the maximum proximity to the target point. To change it, seng command /setradius.
You will receive an answer: "Send new radius in meters (for example 3000)", send new radius then.
Or you ca just send it like that "/setradius 3000" (without quotes)
To drop settings to default, send command /setdefault.

Commands for Points generation:

[Designed to search for Blind-Spots.]
Blind-Spots are places that you can't normaly reach due to deterministic patterns.
These commands will help you get into a completely random place, which with some probability can be a blind spot.
/getpseudo - will send you a random location, generated by simple pseudorandom numbers generator (not quantum).
/getquantum - will send you a random location, generated by Quantum Random Numbers Generator source, set in configuration (by default it's QRNG - https://qrng.anu.edu.au/)
/getqtime - same as getquantum but will also suggest random time for visiting point.

[Designed to search for Intention Driven Anomalies.]
These commands use the effect of the influence of thoughts on quantum probability. Most often they lead you to the things you was thinking about.
/getattractor - will send you an attractor point. For it's generation a few thousands of quantum-random points will be created and then program will find an area with maximum density of these points and calculate it's center as an attractor.
Can be used with parameter, for example: /getattractor[3] - will send you 3 most improbable attractors, found in the area. Parameter can be a digit from 0 to 10.  Usually there are several attractors in the observed zone. 
/getvoid -  The opposite of the attractor point; A place with the minimum density of the point will be found.
Can be used with parameter, for example: /getvoid[4] - will send you 4 most improbable voids, found in the area. Parameter can be a digit from 0 to 10. 
/getpair - will send you both attractor and void-attractor points at once. Can be used with parameter, for example: /getpair[2] - will send you 2 void-attractor pairs, found in the area. 
/getida (or /getanomaly) - will return attractor or a void, dependendent of which one is more improbable. Can be used with parameter: /getida[10]
/scanida (/scanattractor, /scanvoid, /scanpair) - works just like "get" ones, but is making 10 entropy requests to qrng with 30 seconds interval. It supposed to increase the impact of intent, as it persists for a period of time. Can be used with parameter.

[For blind experiments]
Use this command to help us in separating real anomalies from confirmation bias effects.
/getpoint - will send you a mystery point, generated by random command. Can be used in blind-experiments.

Attractors properties:

The power of the attractor is a relative coefficient to verify that the attractor is generated correctly. It is based on the ratio between the density of points near the attractor and in the entire search zone as a whole. In theory, if it is less than two, then it is difficult to call it an anomaly.
Z-score is a coefficient of statistical deviation of anomaly from uniform distribution. For Voids z-score is negative.
The radius of the anomaly shows the size of the territory to which random points are attracted.
Attach the code of the point to your reports that we could find it's mathematical characteristics in a database.
