### INSTRUCTIONS

This new version builds upon the original Fatumbot3 that only worked on Telegram with /<commands> but now can be controlled with buttons and menus.

First up the bot needs a location to calculate the Points from as the center. Send your current location or search for one. You'll be prompted on how to do so.
