#### INSTRUCTIONS  
  
First up you need to send a location from which the points will be calculated. You will be prompted to do so.  
  
##### Main Menu  
  
For the intent-driven anomaly search/mind-matter interaction part of the experiment you have:  
You can enter [1]-[20] after the commands to get that number of points; e.g. /getattractor[3]  
* Attractor (/getattractor) - generate an Attractor point  
* Void (/getvoid) - generate a Void point  
* Anomaly (/getanomaly, /getida) - get the strongest Attractor or Void point  
* Intent Suggestions - get some quantumly random generated word suggestions for an intent to set  
* Pair (/getpair) - get a pair of Attractor and Void points  
* Scan submenu - see below  
  
For the blind spots/breaking determinism/blind-experiment part you have:  
* Blind Spots submenu - see below  
  
Others:  
* My Location - show your currently set location  
* Settings - set your radius (/setradius), and toggle whether to skip/include water points and whether to show thumbnails for Google Street View and Google Earth  
  
##### Blind Spots Submenu  
* Quantum (/getquantum) - get a single quantumly generated point  
* Quantum Time (/getqtime) - same as above but with a suggested time to visit  
* Pseudo (/getpseudo) - generate a single pseudo-random point  
* Mystery Point (/getpoint) - generate a random type of point (for blind-experiments)  
  
##### Scan Submenu  
  
Same as the /get intent-driven anomalies but the bot spends longer scanning.  
* Scan Attractor (/scanattractor)  
* Scan Void (/scanvoid)  
* Scan Anomaly (/scanida, /scananomaly)  
* Scan Pair (/scanpair)
